I've been using Waterfox Classic for a while mainly because I still use DownthemAll and Anticontainer a lot, but I am thinking about biting the bullet and moving to Firefox - so I decided to write my own version of Anticontainer for Firefox for my own use. 

I'm not experienced with Firefox Extension writing or Asynchronous Javascript, so the code is probably bug-ridden, inconsistently styled and contains security holes - but it works on the two or three sites I need it for!

Since there's no interface for DownthemAll, it uses the standard Firefox Download Manager...
