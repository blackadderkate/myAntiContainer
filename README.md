I was a huge fan of Anticontainer, but the move to Quantum broke it - so I decided to write my own version of Anticontainer for Firefox for my own personal use.

I'm not an expert on Firefox Extension writing or Asynchronous Javascript, so the code is probably bug-ridden, inconsistently styled (I copied and pasted stuff from various sites as I was going along) and it probably contains security holes - but it works on the two or three sites I need it for!

Since there's no public API for DownthemAll to send download requests to (as far as I am aware) it uses the standard Firefox Download Manager...

There is also a Helper App written in FreePas (so it is cross platform) to change the modification time of the file to the files' Server Modification Time, and also to use the old _001 numbering scheme for files.
